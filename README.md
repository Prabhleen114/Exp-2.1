# Student Registration Form – HTML5 Validation

## Overview

This project is a responsive Student Registration Form built using HTML5 and CSS3.  
It demonstrates modern front-end development practices with built-in client-side validation and clean UI design.

The application validates user inputs such as name, email, and age using native HTML5 validation features, ensuring better user experience and structured data entry.

## Key Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Responsive form layout

## Validation Techniques Used

The form utilizes native HTML5 validation attributes including:

- `required`
- `type="email"`
- `pattern`
