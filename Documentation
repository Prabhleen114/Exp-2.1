# Project Documentation

## Project Title
Student Registration Form with HTML5 Validation

---

## Objective

To design and implement a responsive web-based student registration form that validates user input using native HTML5 validation mechanisms and CSS-based visual feedback.

---

## Functional Requirements

- Accept student name input
- Validate email format
- Restrict age input using numeric constraints
- Prevent form submission if validation fails
- Provide clear visual feedback for invalid fields

---

## Technical Implementation

### Front-End

- Structured using semantic HTML5 elements
- Styled using CSS3
- Responsive layout design

### Validation Strategy

The application uses browser-native validation features:

- `required` for mandatory fields
- `type="email"` for automatic email format validation
- `pattern` for custom input constraints
- `min` and `max` for numeric restrictions
- CSS `:invalid` selector for real-time visual feedback



## System Requirements

### Hardware
- 4GB RAM minimum
- Standard modern processor
- 1366×768 display or higher

### Software
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)



## Security Consideration

This project uses client-side validation only.  
Client-side validation improves user experience but **does not ensure security**.

For production-grade applications, server-side validation is mandatory to prevent:
- Data tampering
- Bypass attacks
- Malicious input submission



## Conceptual Understanding (Interview / Viva)

### 1. Which HTML5 attributes provide built-in validation?
`required`, `pattern`, `type`, `min`, `max`, `minlength`, `maxlength`

### 2. How can validation messages be customized?
Using JavaScript with `setCustomValidity()` method.

### 3. Difference between `type="email"` and `type="text"`?
`type="email"` enforces email format automatically, while `type="text"` does not validate format.

### 4. How does CSS `:invalid` work?
It applies styles to input fields that fail validation rules.

### 5. Why is client-side validation insufficient?
Because it can be bypassed; server-side validation is required for secure systems.
